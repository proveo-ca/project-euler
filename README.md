# JavaScript Project Euler research
A deep dive into mathematics; different approaches and performances for the problems presented [here](https://projecteuler.net/).

## Requirements
- node ^16.0.0

### To run: 
-  `npm start`

This will run all solutions stored in this repo, comparing them using node's [perf_hook](https://nodejs.org/api/perf_hooks.html).

## About this repo
Please, remember the purpose for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is for you to attempt the problem first;
throw your naive approach in, give it a try. Hopefully, some mathematical principles will be learned along the way.
More info about the project [here](https://projecteuler.net/about#publish).

1. Attempt the problem yourself first. _Spoilers ahead_.
2. Giving up? Comparing other approaches? Have a look at this repo.
3. Feel free to open a PR for any observation found on this study source.

## Roadmap
- 1.0.0: Exercises 001 to 010
- 1.0.1: Add a `README.md` on every exercise folder to display performance outputs
- 1.1.0: Compare with other languages outside of JavaScript
